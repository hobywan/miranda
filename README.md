**miranda** is a [nucleobase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase) sequence analyzer written in Java.  
It computes a probable [miRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA) [secondary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_secondary_structure) from a given sequence,  
regarding the released conformation energy and the number of matched bases.  
It is endowed with a graphical user interface based on [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io):

###### Build

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hobywan/miranda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/hobywan/miranda)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9cjdc6mgnqast9nr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hobywan/miranda)

**miranda** is cross-platform.   
It requires a [recent](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) Java SE to be built from sources (at least 11).  
It relies on [gradle](https://gradle.org) toolchain to build binaries, but it is self-managed though.  
To build and run it, just open a terminal and type:

```bash
./gradlew run                 # on macOS or Linux
gradlew.bat run               # on Windows
```

If you want to create executables, type:

```bash
./gradlew createApp           # on macOS  
gradlew.bat createExe         # on Windows
```
> They will be located under `build/macApp` or `build/launch4j`.

###### Use

**miranda** is very simple to use:

<img src="docs/figures/use.gif" alt="gui" width="600">

Its user interface enables to:

- import and run a given `.txt` sequence file.
- display predicted miRNA secondary structure pattern.
- select conformation energy criterion.
- show stats and conformation energy matrix.

> You can save results by a drag-and-drop to a file.

### Feature <a name="feature"></a>

###### Basic background
[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) and [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA) are nucleic acids which are major macromolecules for all forms of life.  
They differ in their chemical structure since RNA is single-stranded as opposed to DNA.  
A [miRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA) is a small [non-coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA) RNA, which dysregulation can lead to known [diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA#Disease) and cancer.  
It tends to fold to itself while attempting to reach stability that is:

- a maximal number of matched bases,
- a minimal released energy induced by the conformation process.

</table>

A nucleic acid [primary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_structure#Primary_structure) simply refers to its base sequence.  
Its [secondary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_structure#Secondary_structure) refers to its planar conformation.  
Its topology can be quite complex, but is simplified for miRNAs.  
Indeed, it would consist of simple [pseudoknots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoknot)-free strand.

###### Algorithm

**miranda** uses a [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) scheme.  
It actually implements [Nussinov](http://math.mit.edu/classes/18.417/Slides/rna-prediction-nussinov.pdf) algorithm.  
It relies on the computation of each base pair energy, with 4 cases:

<img src="docs/figures/nussinov.png" alt="nussinov-cases" width="420">  

The energy of a given secondary structure is just the sum of matched pairs ones.  
Hence an optimal conformation is an instance which minimizes this energy (which can be multiple).

<img src="docs/figures/energy_total.png" alt="energy" width="520">    

In fact, redundant recursive calls are avoided since only the three cases are taken into account.  
The resolution algorithm involves three steps:

- remove all impossible pairs.
- fill energy and matched pairs matrices (diagonal by diagonal).   
- retrieve index path by backtracking from the very last cell.

  </tr>

###### Future works

Notice that computed solutions are just miRNA **candidates**.  
I will integrate _k_ optimal and suboptimal solutions retrievals for a given _k_.  
It will enable to consider and retrieve all isomorphic solutions.
